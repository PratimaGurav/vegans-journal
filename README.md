## Testing

### Bugs
- Disorted form (add post page)
  - [Error](documentation/testing/bugs/add_post.png) no styling for the comments section.
    Used ckeditor to style the content section but the same was not displayed in the live site with a 404 [Error](documentation/testing/bugs/ckeditor-error.jpg). 
  - [Solution](documentation/testing/bugs/add-post-fix.jpg)Checked with Mentor who told me to check with the tutor team who advised me to rescope the same. Used css styling to style the content form on all devices.


- NoReverseMatch 
  - [Error](documentation/testing/bugs/no-reverse-path.png) No Reverse match found while adding a post to the site.
    There was no slug to the modal, when it was saved, the same slug(an empty string) was used over and over again.
  - [Solution](documentation/testing/bugs/sumbit_post_fix.png) Took the title of the post, and used that as the slug, that what is the save method if the modal is doing, the second error was deleting posts that had no slug to tidy up.

  - ### Known Bugs


## Deployment

### Using Heroku
- Development Enviroment
  1.  Create env.py it needs to contain these 3 variables.
    - [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
    - Secret key is the password of your choice.
    - [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/) postgreSQL.
    ![env file](documentation/readme/env.jpg)
  2. Create requirements.txt file.
  3. Create Procfile containing application name to ensure proper formatting to avoid the deployment to fail.
  4. Commit and push deployment changes to Github.
  5. Create an account and login to Heroku
    - Create a new app, with an appropriate app name and choose a region.
    ![Create App](documentation/readme/heroku-create-app.jpg)
    - In Resources add Heroku Postgres.
    ![Resources](documentation/readme/heroku-resources.jpg)
    - Within your newly created app go to settings go to Config Vars use the DATABASE_URL Value and add it to your env.py file also you need to connect it via settings.py.
    ![Config Vars](documentation/readme/heroku-configvars.jpg)
    - Create a SECRET_KEY Key and the Value as the desired key.
    - Then go to the Deploy tab next to Deployment Method, click GitHub to connect your account and repository.
    - At the bottom of the page hit deploy branch making sure it is set to main.
