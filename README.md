## User Experience (UX)

### Introduction

Vegan's Journal is a full-stack application using mainly the Django full-stack web framework. The purpose of the site is to allow users to connect, spread and share ideas or knowledge about Vegan. 

     
### Audience
The site is targetted to people who wants to know about Vegan and / or trying to be vegan.    

### User stories
I have used GitHubâ€™s Kanban feature to handle the user stories. 

  #### Site User
   1. I want to view a list of posts so that I can select one to read.
   2. I want to search a blog post(using relevant word) and ability to click on a post to read the full article / text.
   3. I want to view the number of likes on each post so that I can see which is the most popular or viral.
   4. I want to view comments on an individual post so that I can read the conversation.
   5. I want to register an account so that I can comment and like.
   6. I want to create, edit and delete my post.
   7. I want to create a category of my own to add content on the site. 
   8. I want to leave comments on a post so that I can be involved in the conversation/s.
   9. I want to like or unlike a post so that I can interact with the content.
   10. I want to create draft posts so that I can finish writing the content later.

  #### Site Admin
   1. I want to create, read, update and delete posts so that I can manage the blog content.
   2. I can approve or disapprove comments so that I can filter out objectionable comments.
   3. I want to view the number of likes on each post so that I can see which is the most popular or viral.
   4. I want to view comments on an individual post so that I can read the conversation.
   5. I want to create draft posts so that I can finish writing the content later.

    
### Design

  - #### Color Scheme
    The main colours used for the site are Dollar Bill Green(#8CB567), La Salle Green (#08823F), Seashell (#EFF0F2), Golden Bell (#E28C1B), white (#FFFFFF) and black (#000000). These colours complement eachother and maintain good contrast levels.

  - #### Typography
    Raleway italic font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat italic is used for headings with Sans Serif as the fallback.
